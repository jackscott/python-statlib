# Getting Started #

  * Visit the [issue tracker](http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-psf/issues/list) and pick a statlib task (if there is one available).

  * Request membership to this project (you'll need to have a google account). Once your task is approved and assigned to you we will add you as a member (within a day or so).

  * It would be most helpful if students familiarized themselves with the [subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/) revision control system. Eventually all code needs to be submitted and maintained via **svn** and this google project. Best starting points are the [Subversion Book](http://svnbook.red-bean.com/) and a [Crash Course in Subversion](http://www.developer.com/tech/article.php/10923_3499816_2). On Unix type sytems the command line `svn` client works very well. For windows users [TortoiseSVN](http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/) seems to be a popular choice.
